# DashBoard
An admin use only Dashboard for visualizing Database contents.
DASHBOARD is constructed using Flask, SQL and D3js library using Replit Platform.
The Dashboard displays 5 different types of graphs representing different sets of data.
I have not focused on styling much due to time restrictions but the data is visualized accurately.
